# Syncretic
Beta, preserved just as it was intended, with modern fixes.

### Overview
Minecraft Beta Edition 1.7.3 - released in 2011, and the most popular version from Minecraft's "golden age." It perfectly encapsulates what the game is all about - pure creativity within an endless sandbox, yet many are deterred by its somewhat clunky playstyle. As with any beta release of a game, it is buggy and lacks many features that keep fans of modern Minecraft from giving it a real chance.

This modpack aims to change that. Running on a modified version of Fabric specifically for Beta 1.7.3, this modpack fixes many of those bugs while also backporting features loved by modern Minecrafters - all while maintaining vanilla parity.

### Work in Progress
- Translations are currently in the works, and unfortunately, only English is supported as of now
- A Discord RPC for this modpack is also being worked on, as it isn't currently compatible


### Important Notes
- This pack is designed specifically for use with MultiMC and its forks, and will not function with other launchers
- Requires Java 17
- While this modpack is compatible with exisiting vanilla b1.7.3 worlds, practice regular backups as this still does remain a modified version of a very old game :)
- Multiplayer is unsupported
