# Syncretic
Beta, preserved just as it was intended, with modern fixes.

### Overview
Minecraft Beta Edition 1.7.3 - released in 2011, and the most popular version from Minecraft's "golden age." It perfectly encapsulates what the game is all about - pure creativity within an endless sandbox, yet many are deterred by its somewhat clunky playstyle. As with any beta release of a game, it is buggy and lacks many features that keep fans of modern Minecraft from giving it a real chance.

This modpack aims to change that. Running on a modified version of Fabric specifically for Beta 1.7.3, this modpack fixes many of those bugs while also backporting features loved by modern Minecrafters - all while maintaining vanilla parity.


### Features
- Increased render distance, while keeping the classic beta fog
- Brightness and FOV sliders added
- More debug info
- Skin and authentication fixes
- Server list added
- Various performance enhancements
- Modern F5 mode
- Cloud height changed to 128 (height limit)
- Unsupported trapdoor placement
- Fixed slab placement
- Modern crafting recipes
- Trees drop apples
- Toggleable full recipe/item viewer
- Fixed inconsistent tool use on certain blocks
- Creative mode added
- Creative mode only music plays in survival
- Main menu theme added


### Important Notes
- **This modpack will not work out of the box - you will need to install an instance of the latest version of Babric (Beta Fabric) from their [download site](https://babric.github.io/use/installer/) for your respective launcher, then drag-and-drop the mods, configs, custom-music and main-menu-theme folders from Syncretic into the folder for your Babric instance**
- This pack is designed specifically for use with MultiMC and its forks, and function is not guaranteed with any other launcher
- Requires Java 17
- While this modpack is compatible with exisiting vanilla b1.7.3 worlds, practice regular backups as this still does remain a modified version of a very old game :)
- Multiplayer is largely untested and not guaranteed to work
